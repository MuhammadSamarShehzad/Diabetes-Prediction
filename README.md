![diabetes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ca7698f-2dd2-46f2-a4be-e154cfb6f5bf)

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models for predicting diabetes using the **Diabetes Prediction dataset**. The dataset includes medical and demographic data from patients, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

The goal of this project is to develop accurate and reliable machine learning models that can predict diabetes status (positive or negative) based on patients' medical history and demographic information. These models can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes and in personalizing treatment strategies.

## Dataset
The **Diabetes Prediction dataset** is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset).

### Dataset Features:
- Age  
- Gender  
- Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Hypertension  
- Heart Disease  
- Smoking History  
- HbA1c Level  
- Blood Glucose Level  

## Project Files
