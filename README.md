![Diabetes Prediction Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ca7698f-2dd2-46f2-a4be-e154cfb6f5bf)  

Welcome to the **Diabetes Disease Prediction Project**! This repository demonstrates the use of machine learning models, specifically ensemble methods, to predict diabetes based on medical and demographic data.

## üöÄ Project Overview  

This project focuses on developing accurate and reliable machine learning models to predict diabetes status (positive or negative) using the **Diabetes Prediction Dataset**. The dataset includes key medical indicators such as age, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, and blood glucose levels.  

The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk individuals and personalizing treatment strategies. By utilizing ensemble methods, the project ensures robust and efficient predictions.

### Dataset Features:  
- **Age:** Age of the patient.  
- **Gender:** Male or Female.  
- **Body Mass Index (BMI):** A measure of body fat based on height and weight.  
- **Hypertension:** Presence or absence of high blood pressure.  
- **Heart Disease:** Presence or absence of heart-related conditions.  
- **Smoking History:** Patient's smoking status.  
- **HbA1c Level:** Average blood glucose level over the past 3 months.  
- **Blood Glucose Level:** Current blood glucose level.
